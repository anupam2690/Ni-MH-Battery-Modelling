# Ni-MH Battery Modelling
Problem Statement: Model the NI-MH battery State of Charge and plot the State of Charge and Voltage values.

How to run the Model:
1) Upload all the project files to Matlab.
2) Run the Inputs.m file.
3) Run the Ni_MH_Battery_SOC_Calculation.slx file.
4) Run the Post_Processing.m file to extract the plots.
5) Analyse and enjoy the results.
